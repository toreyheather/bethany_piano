                            <div class="teachingPhilosophy">
                                <p>The love of the learning process, that which takes place in music and in many other settings outside music, is what has lead me to where I am today.  I love when I understand something in a comprehensive way, and that joy of understanding is where I aim to lead all my students.  I aspire to conduct myself with excellence as a performer and lifelong learner, and to collaborate with colleagues in order to foster community.</p>
                                <p>I like to break concepts into small manageable parts that resonate with the student using musical thinking and non; sometimes we must be mathematicians, scientists, choreographers, and explorers in our approach to music! I like to take these smaller parts, in consideration of the different learning modalities, and give the student a visual, aural, emotional, and physical context in which to place them. </p>
                                <p>It is important for all musicians to draw from their other senses to embody and emote a clear musical idea.  Tools that can be used to convey musical ideas are moods, images, emotions, impressions, and stories; we take those elements and decide how they can best serve the notes on the page for clear expression.  Once the goal is clear between teacher and student, we work together to eradicate tension, constantly improve and reach new levels of understanding, and to have a regularly joyous and revitalizing musical experience in lessons.  My goals for the student are that they know the music inside and out, develop imaginative playing, enjoy the process and always have a sense of confidence that they are achieving their goals.  The confidence and thoughtfulness developed in music lessons can help create well-rounded and conscientious people who know themselves and their learning tendencies, well while being in a constant state of discovery. </p>
                                <p>I am open to working with all ages and all types of students, but I have a particular love for adult students and older beginners.  I like to draw from someone's life experience and intellect as they learn a new skill and work on growing as a musician.  It can be an illuminating and potentially frustrating experience to be a "beginner" again, and I seek to make that experience as positive and comprehensive as possible; it is never too late to make music!</p>
